> The line graph illustrates the amount of goods transported by road, water, rail and pipeline in the UK from 1974 to 2002.

> Overall, goods sent by 4 kind of transportations increased over the period with the most significant rise occuring in water. Notably, road and pipeline maintained the highest and lowest throughout the given years.
>
> At 1974, the majority of goods were transported by road at 70 million tonnes

> The line graph illustrates average amount of money spent on cell phone, national and international fixed-line services in America from 2001 to 2010.
>
> Overall, while the expenditure on cell phone increased significantly, the figure for national fixed-line services was opposite. Notably, the expenditure on international fixed-line services maintained the lowest throughout the most of the given years.
>
> In 2001, about 700 dollars was spent on national fixed-line services by US residents, in comparison with 280 dollars for international fixed-line services and 200 dollars for cell phone. Over next 5 years, the figure for national fixed-line services drop dramatically to 500 dollars, equal to that of cell phone, which witnessed a rapid rise. However, the expenditure on international fixed-line services fluctuated slightly to 300 dollars.
>
> From 2006 to 2010, a similar trend was observed when compared to the previous period. The amount of money spent on cell phone continued to climb and reached its peak in 2010, with a figure of 750 dollars. In contrast, the figure for national fixed-line services kept falling and hit the lowest point at 400 dollars. Meanwhile, that of international fixed-line services increased slightly but negligible.
